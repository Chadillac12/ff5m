# Forge-X Session Log

## Session 2025-01-29

### Tasks Completed
1. ✅ **Repository Analysis**: Used Gemini CLI to analyze entire codebase structure
2. ✅ **Architecture Dossier**: Created comprehensive 11-section technical document
3. ✅ **CLAUDE.md**: Updated project guidance for future Claude Code sessions  
4. ✅ **Memory Bank**: Initialized persistent memory system for project context
5. ✅ **AD5X Porting Guide**: Documented complete porting strategy for Adventurer 5X

### Key Discoveries
- **Boot System**: SysV-style init with S* scripts managing service lifecycle
- **Macro System**: Sophisticated G-code extension system bridging UI to system
- **Safety Architecture**: Dual-boot, backup/restore, and atomic deployment
- **Development Workflow**: Live sync.sh deployment without firmware reflashing
- **Configuration Management**: Layered .cfg system with include hierarchy

### Files Created
- `FORGE-X_ARCHITECTURE_DOSSIER.md` - Complete technical analysis (11 sections)
- `.claude/memory/project_context.md` - Project identity and context
- `.claude/memory/architecture_summary.md` - Technical architecture memory
- `.claude/memory/session_log.md` - This session log

### Insights for Future Sessions
- System is well-architected with clear separation of concerns
- Strong safety mechanisms prevent bricking
- Development process is mature with proper deployment tools
- Architecture supports extensibility while maintaining stability
- Porting to AD5X is feasible with documented hardware differences

### Next Session Goals
- Monitor architecture evolution
- Track new feature development  
- Update documentation as needed
- Support development or debugging tasks
